# File Conventions

- Use UTF-8 encoding for all narrative documents.
- Store metadata in YAML front matter at the top of narrative files when applicable.
- Name timeline entries using the `YYYY-MM-DD_event-name.md` pattern for clarity.
- Keep all lore documents written in the third person unless otherwise specified by project guidelines.
